# **Preparation Steps**
- **Mac**: Open the terminal and enter:
  ```sh
  /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="/tmp/ChromeProfile"
  ```
- **Windows**: Press **Win + R** to open "Run", type `cmd` to open the command prompt, then enter:
  ```sh
  chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\selenium\ChromeProfile"
  ```
  **Note**: Chrome needs to be in the system path. If it is not, use the following command instead:
  ```sh
  "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\selenium\ChromeProfile"
  ```
  The path before the command points to the original Chrome installation location.

After running the command, **open Weibo in the newly launched Chrome window and log in**.  
(This specific Chrome window will be used for the automated process, ensuring that your Weibo account remains logged in. Do not close this window.)

## **Usage Instructions**
- **If you prefer running the code directly in a Jupyter Notebook**, use the `Weibo_Complaint.ipynb` file.
- **If you want to run Python directly**, you can ignore the notebook file.

### **Installation**
Before running the script, install the required dependencies in the terminal:
```sh
pip install streamlit selenium webdriver-manager
```

### **Running the Application**
Start the application by running the following command in the terminal:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
This will **automatically open a webpage**, where you can enter the Weibo complaint link and click the **"Start Complaint"** button at the bottom.

### **Stopping the Application**
If you **close the browser tab**, you may notice that the terminal does not accept new commands.  
To stop the process, press **`Ctrl + C`** in the terminal.

## **Customizing the Complaint Text**
If you want to modify the complaint text:
1. Open the `app.py` file.
2. Locate the **preset complaint content** inside the script.
3. Replace it with your desired text.
4. **Make sure to keep the original single quotes** to enclose the Chinese text properly.

Example:
```python
complaint_text = 'Your custom complaint message here'
```
Ensure that the Chinese content is **enclosed in English single quotes (`'`),** without deleting them.
